# SubDomain-Enumeration
A little tool I wrote to help with subdomain enumeration.

Usage:

-s is used to add domain. Exclude {http://}. Example: -s example.com  
-w is used to add the wordlist. Include path to the wordlist. Example: -w /path/to/wordlist.txt  
-o is used to define an output file in which the full url will be printed. Example: -o text.txt  

-h is used for help
